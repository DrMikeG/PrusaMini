# Summary

This all started when I wanted to print the fantastic wand that was designed by Superstar_beki but wanted to print it broken up vertically rather than horizontally, and rather than having to stick the pieces together, create some sort of screw fitting........but what is a wand without a core?!

In true Wizarding World fashion, I have created a wand where you can print whichever core has picked you! Why not try....

A cherry red dragon heart string
A pearly white unicorn hair
A golden phoenix tail feather

This wand is printed in 4 parts. A handle, a central section, a tip and a core. The core is used to hold all the other 3 sections together, and remains hidden inside the wand. The core can only be revealed by unscrewing the tip and removing the central section.

WARNING: Always ask permission of the wand owner before revealing the core - it is magical after all and can be temperamental. Unfortunately, we can not be held responsible for any spells back-firing.
