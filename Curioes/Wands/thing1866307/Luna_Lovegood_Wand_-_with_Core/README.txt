# Summary

This all started when I wanted to print the fantastic wand that was designed by brycelowe but wanted to print it broken up vertically, and rather than having to stick the pieces together, create some sort of screw fitting........but what is a wand without a core?!

In true Wizarding World fashion, I have created a wand where you can print whichever core has picked you! Why not try....

A cherry red dragon heart string
A pearly white unicorn hair
A golden phoenix tail feather

This wand is printed in 4 parts. A handle, a central section, a tip and a core. The core is used to hold all the other 3 sections together, and remains hidden inside the wand. The core can only be revealed by unscrewing the tip and removing the central section.

After a request I updated the handle with a 4 petal design as produced by brycelowe. There are 2 files available; the handle on its own (so anyone who has already printed the wand can update it), and the set of all 3 parts.

Update (14-Dec-17): After a request, I extended the wand to be screen accurate to 33.25cm in length - see the file 'luna wand_extended 3325'. The Original core size will fit in this new wand. Enjoy!

WARNING: Always ask permission of the wand owner before revealing the core - it is magical after all and can be temperamental. Unfortunately, we can not be held responsible for any spells back-firing.
