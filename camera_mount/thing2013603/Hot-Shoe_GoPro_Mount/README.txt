# Summary

Need to mount an action camera or any of the myriad of devices that use the GoPro mounting system to your hot-shoe equipped dSLR or mirrorless camera? Now you can attach those devices to your camera via the hot-shoe.  Just print this and you'll be on your way.  It's been tested and fits snug, but not overly.  You could easily move your camera around without fear of the attached device disconnecting.

The holes are designed for an M5 x 20mm bolt and locknut.

Print it and go do something cool!
