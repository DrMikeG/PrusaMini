Screen pegs are not far enough apart (+2mm width or +1.25mm height - top of screen is the right height)
The pegs themelves are a good size - little small
Side ribs are 1.25mm to far apart

All the holes are a bit tight for m2.5, but are tappable

Clam shell right, revision 1.

Screw fixing worked well.

Front plate holding the screen unit it a bit weak.

GPS holder is good size (can be less tall) but needs wire out. (These will class with clamshell screw fixing positions)

Unit needs to be talled for the wires top and bottom, but can be shallower.
